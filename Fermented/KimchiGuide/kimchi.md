# Kimchi

This is actually the 3rd version of kimchi I have tried through trial and error.
It's vegan, super simple, and gets appropriately funky over time, perfect for jigae and kimchi pancakes.

# Warning:
_This recipe is still a WIP. I need to compare notes with my actual recipe book, 
but it's sooooo far away and I am on the couch and it's cold today._

### Reference

(1) - cut into matchsticks means to run your knife through it creating the shape of tiny little matchsticks.
        There is a technique to this. I'll link a video here.
        Also note: much of this daikon will be made into a separate batch of cubed radish kimchi (optional).

(2) - as much as you can sanely allow: for me it's pretty much as much garlic as I can get Garret to peel.
        Or as much as I have patients to peel, but, I am a garlic freak; use your own discernment.
