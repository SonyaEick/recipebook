### Base Ingredients

| Base Ingredients | Measurement                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Napa Cabbage     | 1 full cabbage - cut into ideal bite size peices |
| Daikon Radish    | 1/2 large - cut into cubes [(1)](#reference)     |
| Fennel Bulb      | 1 large - bulb cut like cabbage                  |
| Sea Salt         | 1-2 cups                                         |

1. Put chopped cabbage and fennel bulb in a bowl with salt water.
2. Put cubed radish in its own bowl of salt water if you are making a small side of cubed radish kimchi. (optional)
3. Let these sit in salt water for 30min - 1hr, tossing and mixing by hand periodically.

### Note: 
Make sure to check on the soaking vegetables every few minutes to make sure it isnt too salty.
If it gets saltier than the ocean, drain and rinse. You can take bite of cabbage or radish to double check.
Radish will get saltier than the cabbage quicker, so its crucial that you not let the radish sit
with salt only on it. Cabbage can take a few minutes with only salt if you prefer a little bit saltier kimchi.
Generally the cabbage and radish should be sitting in water no saltier that the sea though.

### Reference

(1) - cut into matchsticks means to run your knife through it creating the shape of tiny little matchsticks.
        There is a technique to this. I'll link a video here.
        Also note: much of this daikon will be made into a separate batch of cubed radish kimchi.
