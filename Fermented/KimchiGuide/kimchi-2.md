1. Chop daikon & carrots to resemble matchsticks. Add to a mixing bowl. 
Everything on this page will go into this one mixing bowl.
2. Slice green onion into little circles as if you were chopping it for miso soup. Do the same
for the fennel fringe. If you need to, slice it lengthwise to get ti to a smaller size to resemble
green onion. Optional if you enjoy the larger pieces. I prefer hiding the fennel.
3. peel and chop ginger into coins against the grain to prevent "hairs" persisting.
4. peel garlic, and rough chop onion.
5. add onion, garlic, ginger to a food processor and blend into a smooth paste.
6. add blended paste to the matchsticks, add all remaining ingredients to the bowl and mix until 
desired spice level and saltiness.

### Reference

(1) - cut into matchsticks means to run your knife through it creating the shape of tiny little matchsticks.
There is a technique to this. I'll link a video here.
Also note: much of this daikon will be made into a separate batch of cubed radish kimchi (optional).
