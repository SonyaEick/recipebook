### Reference

(1) - cut into matchsticks means to run your knife through it creating the shape of tiny little matchsticks.
        There is a technique to this. I'll link a video here.
        Also note: much of this daikon will be made into a separate batch of cubed radish kimchi.

(2) - as much as you can sanely allow: for me its pretty much as much garlic as I can get Garret to peel.
        Or as much as I have patients to peel, but, I am a garlic freak; use your own discernment.
