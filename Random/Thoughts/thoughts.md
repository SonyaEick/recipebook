My thoughts on anything that strikes me worth writing about. A diary, if you will.

# 2022

## September

WED 21
- baked bread from starter discard
- took care of a ticket but it wasnt complete
- wanted to work out or run but the opportunity never felt opportune.
- felt a mental shift; an upgrade to my subconscious. something good is happening.
