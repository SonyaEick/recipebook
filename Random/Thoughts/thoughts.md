# 2022

## September

WED 21
- baked bread from [starter discard](../../Bread/discard-bread.md)
- took care of a ticket, but it wasn't verified as complete by requester.
- been a documentation machine lately, which is actually how this whole recipebook thing started.
- wanted to work out or run but the opportunity never felt opportune.
- felt a mental shift; an upgrade to my subconscious. something good is happening.

THUR 22
- leftover curry is so incredible, man.
- I'm doing this on my lunch
- I'm addicted to documentation styling. I told a coworker I was going HAM on docs and they said they've heard. I feel like that's saying something. lol
- need to plan for kimchi party.
- today is auspicious.
