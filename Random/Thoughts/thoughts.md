# 2022

## September

WED 21
- baked bread from [starter discard](../../Bread/discard-bread.md)
- took care of a ticket, but it wasn't verified as complete by requester.
- been a documentation machine lately, which is actually how this whole recipebook thing started.
- wanted to work out or run but the opportunity never felt opportune.
- felt a mental shift; an upgrade to my subconscious. something good is happening.

THUR 22
- leftover curry is so incredible, man.
- I'm doing this on my lunch
- I'm addicted to documentation styling. I told a coworker I was going HAM on docs and they said they've heard. I feel like that's saying something. lol
- need to plan for kimchi party.
- today is auspicious.

## December

FRI 16
- I'm on a new mac so I have to get it all set up.
- It's been a while since I've done this so, it's taking me a second to get this thing set up
- I did see something about how you can add react to github pages, which is appealing. I think I'll give that a try since its free.
- I cant remember if github pages allows you to start up a server but I suppose it does not. lol. I guess we just push.
- Things are feeling like theyre linking up in a positive way. I guess it will be positive no matter what.

SUN 18
- Holiday cookie party is today; I'm making [danish butter cookies](../../Desserts/Cookies/butter-cookies.md).
- Butter cookies are taking a while, so I may as well update recipes and whatnot.
- Been looking for a house for my mom but not wanting to pay for it. really annoying process.
