# 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

**Author**: Stephen R. Covey

=====================

### Changing your paradigm

- Your mental image and projection of the world.
- Your paradigm shapes your reality and outer world. Perceptions, world views, expectations.
- when you get impatient or demand more too soon, you make faulty decisions that come from selfishness that 
  will ultimately lead to the end of whatever good thing you are trying to get more of.
- forgive yourself and forgive others. let it go. forgive and forget.
- be proactive; take responsibility for your choices


### Habit 1: You are the programmer.

Be Proactive

- your life is a product of your values not your feelings.
- your life is a product of your decisions not your conditions.
- to be proactive means you take the initiative to do whatever is necessary to make good things happen.
- youre the creative force of your own life
- **The awareness that you are the programmer. It is the bugging awareness that the best way to
  predict your future is to create it**
- the opposite is to be reactive to other people, your job, your circumstances, or your environment.
  - "i am what other people have made me" avoids responsibility.

- between what happens to us (stimulus) and our response to the stimulus is a space,
  in that space lies our freedom and power to choose our response. In those choices
  lie our growth and our happiness. This is what Victor Frankle discovered.
  - Victor Frankle learned this technique while being tested on in a concentration camp.
  - self awareness, imagination, and conscience.
- "what is this situation asking of me" instead of "what do I ask of it; why are they doing this to me?'
- exercise your own independent will. freedom is the considiton of the person. you have control over freedom, 
  but not liberty in some cases. **In many situations, the more you control your freedom and expand and deepen it, 
  eventually it will influence your liberty -- that is your opions that are available**
- your head will create your world. your response to the stimulus will eventually influence the stimulus.
- _free will is not your ability to move through the world. free will is your mental/emotional soul's will to continue_
  - so essentially we all truly do have free will among our circumstances.
- The thing in concentration camps that enabled people to survive was
  - vision of the future
  - sense of meaning, contribution yet to make; work yet to do
  - "mans search for meaning" book by victor frankle


- imagine two circles:
  - larger outer circle: of concern
    - things you cant do anything about
    - weather, international events, force of nature, etc
  - smaller inner circle: of influence
    - things you can do something about.
    - health, work, family
  - focus on inner circle. as you do that, it gets larger & youre more able to influence
  - reactive person focuses on outer circle. things outside that they have no control over.
  - gossiping or discussing the outer circle with others may seem to unite, but there is a unseen way 
    that this stresses the relationships to where it will eventually break. bc youre doing the opposite thing
    and the inner circle begins to wither.
  - **love the feeling is the fruit of love the verb.** the essence of being proactive. love is something you do.
    love the feeling comes from sacrificing and showing love. "i dont feel it" is solved by doing the work first.
    - it doesnt happen over night. have the courage to act upon your conscience; that is the essence of proactivity.

  
### Habit 2: Write the program

Have the end in mind.

- begin with the end in mind. if youre the programmer, then write it. dont just live some other program
  that doesnt meet your needs.
- you have a vision, you can choose it based on values. habit of personal leadership. leadership deals with the direction
  one's life. you decide your value system.
- the opposite if to have no sense of creation, no sense of mission, no envisioning of the future, let life 
  happen with no particular focus of objective.
- the test of our meaning.
- **life is always created twice.**
  - first is mental. intellectual. mind spirit, the blueprint before its built
  - second is physical. home office, car. the product of the blueprint
  - make sure the blueprint is really what you want.
  - if you have the end in mind you have a better trajectory.
    - if everyone has the same end in mind, how useful is that? quite.
    - exercise with the end in mind
    - have a meeting with the end in mind
    - begin each day, project, with the end in mind
    - fail: members dont share the common vision.
    - success: shared vision.
    - because every decision will be influenced by the main vision of each person. have a continuing sense of guidance.
- create powerful mission statements
  - blah
