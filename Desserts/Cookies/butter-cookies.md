# Danish Butter Cookies

My first attempt at anything shortbread-like.
I used [this recipe](https://thegardeningfoodie.com/danish-butter-cookies/?unapproved=10024&moderation-hash=1b5d43c32d7d49ecd12fdfea620cdc06#comment-10024).
I modified the recipe by using vanilla bean paste in lieu of vanilla extract.

| (Optional) Granulated/Sanding Sugar | Enough to coat the outside of the cookie logs. |

## Prep:
1. Whip 6 sticks of room temperature butter in the mixer with 3 cups of powdered sugar until very fluffy and light; 
about 5 minutes.
2. Add 6 teaspoons of vanilla bean paste and continue to whip mixture for 5 minutes.
3. Add 6 cups of flour, one cup at a time to fully incorporate.

## Bake: 
### _**325 degrees for 20-28 minutes**_
4. Preheat oven to 325.
5. Get a pan full of granualted/sanding sugar and roll cookie logs onto the sugar to coat the outside.
6. Slice the logs into thin cookie slices and place them on a silicone mat or parchment paper.
7. Bake for 20-28 minutes or until edges are golden, but center is a light color.
8. Cool for about 10 minutes before serving so cookies can crisp up.

Done.

### Notes:

- _Mistake 1_: I didn't thaw my butter ahead of time so I had a few sticks of fridge-cold butter and a few freezer-cold 
butter. I chopped it up and microwaved it for 30 seconds at a time until it was soft enough without melting.
- _Mistake 2_: I put this mix into the fridge to melt overnight but when I pulled it out in the morning it was super hard.
I had to find a way to soften this dough & bake within 4 hours for a cookie party. What I had to do was break it apart
and mix it as cold crumbs with a few teaspoons of heated milk.
- _Mistake 3_: I tried to pipe these cookies through a piping bag and there was no friggin way it was going to come
out of that thing. I really gave it a good try. I ended up rolling them into logs and then rolling the logs
in granulated/sanding sugar.


- Adaptation coming soon: Mantecaditos (Puerto Rican shortbread with almond extract & a marachino cherry center.)
