# Sonya Eick's Recipe Book

A compilation of Sonya-curated recipes.
I have these set up in classic tutorial/documentation style.

### Other pages of little concern:

| Pages                                  | Description                                                                                                                                  |

| [ Diary ](Random/Thoughts/thoughts.md) | Random journal-like notes of little meaning to anyone.                                                                                       |
| [ Books ](Random/books.md)             | If you want to read a book I've read without reading it, I made some notes, but you should really just read those books. Also maybe reviews. |
